# Apollo Evaluation Project - AI Coding Assistant Instructions

## React Coding Guidelines

- use the function statement if possible - no arrow functions
- don't use too many comments - the code should be self-documenting - sample: projects/api/src/database/create-db.ts

Sample:

```ts
// Navigate to the new movie detail page
navigate(`/movies/${data.addMovie.id}`);
```

This comment is not necessary, as the code is self-explanatory. Instead, focus on writing clear and concise code that communicates its purpose without excessive comments.
