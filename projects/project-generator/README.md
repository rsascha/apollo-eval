# Vite Apollo GraphQL Node.js Express Template

## Usage

```sh
npm create vite-apollo-fs@latest
```

## Result

This template creates a Vite project with Apollo Server and Node.js Express, including:

- api: Apollo Server with GraphQL support
- codegen: Code generation for TypeScript types from GraphQL schema
- web-ui: React frontend with Apollo Client

You get sample code for a GraphQL API and a React frontend that can be used as a starting point for your own projects.

Web-Socket support is included for real-time updates.
