# Apollo Eval

I never had the opportunity to work with GraphQL in a real project, so I decided to build a small evaluation project to explore it.

This is a GraphQL evaluation project with an Apollo Server backend and a React frontend. It demonstrates modern GraphQL development with `*.graphql` files, TypeScript, and code generation.

- [development workflow](projects/README.md)

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev # starts the Apollo Server, the Web UI and the Code Generator
```

- Apollo Server: [http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql)
- Web UI: [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)
